# Learn a sequence
# compare LSTM, CNN and Attention networks

This demonstration learns a sequence (sine wave data) with CNN, LSTM, Att models.
It was deisgned to compare learning models


### LSTM
227.472229 GOps and 0.032284 M parameters
results were also not as precise as other techniques

### CNN
0.208236 GOps and 0.000049 M parameters

### Attention: 
2.537019 GOps and 0.000145 M parameters

In this task the fastest to learn and best performing model is the CNN, followed by Att and last is the LSTM!
